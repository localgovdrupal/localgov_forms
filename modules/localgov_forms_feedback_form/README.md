# LocalGov Forms - Feedback Form

## What is it?
This is a small module that creates a feedback for for your LocalGov Drupal website.

It asks a simple question: "Was this page helpful?".

If someone answers "Yes", they are asked if they'd like to share what is good about this page. If they answer "No", they have the opportunity to say how the page can be improved.

## How to use it.
- Install it like any other Drupal module from the "Extend" page.
- Add a block of type "Webform" to your site via the `Admin > Structure > Blocks` page.
- When the form is submitted, results will be stored in the database. They can be accessed by going to `Admin > Structure > Webforms`, clicking on the "LocalGov Forms Feedback Form", and then choosing "Results".
